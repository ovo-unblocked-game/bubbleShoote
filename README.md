"Charlie Destroyer of Worlds" was a game originally made for the multiplayer touch screen (or as we called it, MUTT) board outside the Digital Corps on Ball State University's campus. Aaram Rosco Kamali was the lead designer on the project and I was the lead developer. All of the code was originally hosted on Bitbucket, but was moved here. The code has been modified so I could host the game on my website. The game still plays the same, but I just added those little tweaks to make it much better! 

The game is playable, but the board's dimensions (1920px x 1080px) were kept. When playing the game, you may want to zoom out in your browser.
